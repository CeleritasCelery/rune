# interval-tree

---

An interval tree implementation using Red-Black Tree as its underlying data structure.

This crate is initially designed for storing emacs's face intervals, so you may see connections through the API.

Credit of the RB Tree's algorithms go for the infamous textbook, *Algorithms, 4th Edition* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
