* round point to the nearest grapheme
* benchmark
- benchmark against rope implementations
- benchmark the fastest way to convert codepoint to byte index. Maybe use stable indexes
* convert line endings
Convert \r\n to \n
* add from_file constructor
* make point a public type
We need to be able to take a reference to point and get offsets from it
