* Text Buffer
An implementation of a gap buffer for use in rune.

** benchmarks
Basic benchmarks located under ~/benches~ directory. Run with ~cargo bench~

** fuzzing
Fuzzer located at ~fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_buffers.rs~. After installing [[https://crates.io/crates/cargo-fuzz][cargo fuzz]], run with ~cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_buffers~. Note that the same file has a function ~create_repo~ to automatically create a reproduction test of the fuzzer output. Add these to the unit tests.

** reference tests
Reference tests are located at ~reference-tests/src/main.rs~. Change to that directory and run with ~cargo test~. These are a set of [[https://github.com/josephg/editing-traces][editing traces]] developed by the author of [[https://github.com/josephg/jumprope-rs][jumrope-rs]].

If failures are encountered, you can run against the reference javascript implementation to get the exact failing change with ~reference-tests/run.py~.
