#+title: Next steps for Remac
* Don't leak memory
This is a pre-req for adding GC. Basically make sure that we don't loose track of any memory, if we don't collect it right now.
* GC
** create a rooted generic object to register things as roots
Moving a reference into root should be safe to fix the lifetime
** look into mutable strings and soundness
* VM
** make functions thread local
Or at least add an option for it
* define sexp macro
Not sure if this can be done with just a regular macro or would require a proc macro. But this would let us decouple our tests from the reader in a clean way.
* define benchmarks
* Add reader macro hooks
* Steps to add a new object
- define in area.rs
- add boxing function
- define in object
- implement intoObject
- implement tryfrom object
