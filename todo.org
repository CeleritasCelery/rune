#+title: Next steps for Rune
* Path to MVP

* define benchmarks
* Define special forms as subr's
Currently symbol-function of a special form will return nil
* add call variants (call1, call2, call3)
This will let us remove the need for the intermediate vector when trying to call a function. If the underlying type requires a vector (I.e. Interpreted or bytecode) then we can make one, but otherwise we can just pass arguments to a native function.
* make rooted_iter fallible
* can we make rooted_iter be generic over any iterators?
* See how much we can unify the interpters
* Steps to add a new object type
- define in gc/alloc.rs
- add boxing function
- define in object
- impl ~IntoObject~
- impl ~TaggedPtr~
- implement tryfrom object
- implement tracing
- Add to ~OwnedObject~
- Add to ~ObjectAllocation~
* GUI steps
- Display a text widget in window
- display a buffer in the window
- custom widget the get's a slice of the buffer
- allow buffer to be edited
- new UI thread
