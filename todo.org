#+title: Next steps for Rune
* GC
** Add trace derive
* Objects
** implement vec without lifetime parameter
This would let the Object lifetime be covariant instead of invariant. But the problem is that we need to reimplement everything for our vec type. I actually don't think invariance will be such a problem once we update the gc borrowing.
** Fix mutable cons being unsound so we can remove all that  cloning
** Find a better way to define symbols in the code
* define benchmarks
* Add reader macro hooks
* Steps to add a new object
- define in arena.rs
- add boxing function
- define in object
- implement intoObject
- implement tryfrom object
- implement tracing
