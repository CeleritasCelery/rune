#+title: Next steps for Rune
* GC
** implement marking as a grey stack instead of recursive
** Add trace derive
* Break core code out from the rest of the code
This will probably mean defining more traits to implement things in other crates.
* Cons
** rewrite cons as a heap only type
Can move the constant field to the alignment marker and remove the generic lifetime argument
* define benchmarks
* Add reader macro hooks
* Steps to add a new object
- define in arena.rs
- add boxing function
- define in object
- implement intoObject
- implement tryfrom object
