#+title: Next steps for Remac
* build REPL
* change error type to box dyn
This will reduce coupling in the system by allowing different modules to define their own errors
* make the lisp object non-GC
Gc should be a special wrapper around normal lisp objects
* implement while loop
* define sexp macro
Not sure if this can be done with just a regular macro or would require a proc macro. But this would let us decouple our tests from the reader in a clean way.
* change cons access to functions
That we can change the implementation of car and cdr when we want
* define benchmarks
* Add reader macro hooks
