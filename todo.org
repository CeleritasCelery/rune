#+title: Next steps for Rune
* GC
** pass arena type everywhere
** define a trace trait
** store a list of vtables in the gc
** add a safe way to create new gc pointers

* define sexp macro
Not sure if this can be done with just a regular macro or would require a proc macro. But this would let us decouple our tests from the reader in a clean way.
* define benchmarks
* Add reader macro hooks
* Steps to add a new object
- define in arena.rs
- add boxing function
- define in object
- implement intoObject
- implement tryfrom object
