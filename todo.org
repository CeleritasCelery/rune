#+title: Next steps for Rune
* GC
** create a rooted generic object to register things as roots
Moving a reference into root should be safe to fix the lifetime
** look into mutable strings and soundness
* define sexp macro
Not sure if this can be done with just a regular macro or would require a proc macro. But this would let us decouple our tests from the reader in a clean way.
* define benchmarks
* Add reader macro hooks
* Steps to add a new object
- define in arena.rs
- add boxing function
- define in object
- implement intoObject
- implement tryfrom object
