#+title: Next steps for Rune
* GC
** ensure that only 1 arena is active at a time
** define a trace trait
** store a list of vtables in the gc
** add a safe macro to create new gc pointers
* Cons
** rewrite cons as a heap only type
Can move the constant field to the alignment marker and remove the generic lifetime argument
** move invalid list checking to the end of the iterator
This way we don't need every single ~next~ to return a result. Just have one check that must be called before it drops or it panics.

* define benchmarks
* Add reader macro hooks
* Steps to add a new object
- define in arena.rs
- add boxing function
- define in object
- implement intoObject
- implement tryfrom object
